a friend told me recently
that everything
all of us
is just springs

at first I deny and dawdle
both legs pinnes
but stomach roils
collapsing over itself
child on swivel chair
then snaps mousetrap
teeth gnashing nothing

I picture bended metal
spangled and spit-shone clean
spinning while staying still
coiled at birth

the day loses its capacity
to remake itself
a hutch growing distant
cascading into deep
the water runs over me
bare feet over meadow
a sour blue
a pickled sky
my insides stapled together
in the murmured

blood humming a song I don't yet know
hand on the gathering burn
again the gush and the pull
the clamor of redundancy

a breathless croak of light
arcs fire hydrant
into my middle so I 
can't breathe 
can't shape the marvel
into anything it isn't
I pry but the springs
oscilate the other way
pogo-stick subliminal
dreamlike ambition
tightens wasp around me
cinch and snare
whole body immobile

I cannot grab hold of my tender
yawning belly
apex predator
up on its hind legs
crunch and zeal
the keen want feels settled
until it bottoms out
with the mellow thing
awkward and sinking
sparks into smoke
teenage-toned splurging
a name won't make it go away
any faster

hush or it will find you
this banal
sharp and slow
tamped down
a haunted wringing out
